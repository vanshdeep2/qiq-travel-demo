  'Altair Travel customer LTV is £12,000 over 24 months based on premium UK tour and cruise benchmarks (avg booking £3,800 x 3.2 repeat bookings). Annualised contact volume is 14,300 (2,200 contacts in the 8-week period x 6.5). Dissatisfied contacts (CSAT below 3) are 18% of volume = 2,574 annually. Churn rate for dissatisfied customers is 38%. Dissatisfied revenue at risk = 2,574 x 38% x £12,000 = £11.74M. Repeat contact waste £450K and unresolved escalation premium £725K bring total annualised revenue at risk to £12.9M. Coaching-protected LTV £4.5M and CSAT recovery value £2.4M total £6.9M protected annually. All figures are estimates.'
